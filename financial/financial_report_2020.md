# Financial report 2020

This is a brief financial summary for the financial year 2020, the first (partial) year for the Software Underground as a non-profit.


## General remarks

Software Underground was a project of Agile Scientific. In about 2019 we decided to incorporate as a non-profit, mainly to make it easier and more attractive to donate to, both for organizations and individuals. We took this step in April 2020.

Before that point, Agile paid for all of Software Underground's activities — and received all of its donations. Agile continued to pay for most of the organization's activities after incorporation, because it took several months to obtain a credit card for the organization. 

As a result, the books for 2020 are 'strange'. On Agile's side, it donated to Software Underground. On Software Underground's side, it had no expenses (but did not receive an official donation). Since the organization cannot issue tax receipts, it makes no difference to anything; it was merely the simplest way to manage it.

I expect that 2021 will be a much more indicative year, in terms of telling us what our income and expenses look like.


## Summary of relevant events

- Incorporated on 29 April 2020.
- Opened bank account on 26 August 2020 — some delays due partly to COVID-19 pandemic.
- Got the credit card on 18 November 2020 — more delays!
- Set financial year end: 31 December.
- Appointed bookkeeper: Katie Condon, myrgan.com, Mahone Bay, NS, Canada.

## Assets and liabilities

The society had CAD13,440.34 in its chequing account at the end of the year and CAD2000 in a 12-month GIC (guaranteed investment certificate, equivalent to cash). The GIC is required to secure the credit card and will be repurchased when it matures in 2021.

The society had no liabilities at the end of the year.


## Cash flow

At the end of the year, the society was approximately balancing recurring monthly income and expenses, both of which were around CAD350.


## Major donations

- USD5000 from Dell Technologies for the Computational Field Camp. This was originally received by Agile and passed on to Software Underground as soon as Software Underground had a bank account. The event itself is currently on hold, until people are able to travel more freely.
- USD10,000 from Dell Technologies for TRANSFORM 2020. This contributed to the profit made by that event, which was handed over to the organization by Agile in December 2020. The proceeds continue to help pay for events run by Software Underground.
- USD1344 from individuals.

The organization also received USD25,000 of services from Amazon AWS as an in-kind donation.
