# Financial report 2021

This is a brief financial summary for the financial year 2021, the first full year for the Software Underground as a non-profit organization. Our financial year runs from 1 January to 31 December.


## General remarks

Software Underground was a project of [Agile Scientific](https://agilescientific.com). In about 2019 we decided to incorporate as a non-profit, mainly to make it easier and more attractive to donate to, both for organizations and individuals. We took this step in April 2020, but there was considerable financial overlap between Agile and Software Underground until the end of 2020. Things were simpler in 2021, with Software Underground operating as a fully autonomous entity; accordingly, this was the first normal financial year.


## Summary of relevant events

- Agile started as a corporate sponsor at the beginning of the year, with a monthly subscription of USD 512.
- Software Underground ran TRANSFORM 2021, which raised CAD 6688.05 net.
- Our greatest expense continues to be Slack, which cost CAD 4175.44 in 2021 (about CAD 350 per month).
- We received donations from 24 subscribers, 80 one-time donors, and 2 organizations.
- Retained bookkeeper: Katie Condon, myrgan.com, Mahone Bay, NS, Canada.
- Retained accountant: Belliveau Veinotte Inc, Bridgewater, NS, Canada.


## Assets and liabilities

The society had CAD 24,695.23 in its chequing account at the end of the year. This is an increase of 83.7% compared to 2020's closing balance of CAD 13,440.34.

The society also owns CAD 2000 in a 12-month GIC (guaranteed investment certificate, equivalent to cash). The GIC is required to secure the credit card and will be repurchased when it matures later in 2021.

The society had no liabilities at the end of the year.


## Cash flow

The society continues to approximately balance recurring monthly income and expenses.


## Major income items
